### More resources
 * [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): You should know about Python Enhancement Proposals, and _especially_ PEP 8. 
 * There are a lot of other [Jekyll themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) that you could use. (That's not the only list of themes either.)
 * Another blogging option is [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), which is written in Python and can be made to integrate nicely with Python Jupyter notebooks.
