# Hipster Game:

Ask students to come up with an algorithm (consisting of a set of written rules/system) 
for deciding which of the photos are hipsters, based on the known labelling of hipsters 
given by us.  

This is their first experience with supervised learning, where one tries to learn something 
from a given set of training data based on the features of the dataset.  Here the training 
set is Set A and the answers for this set are put up at the beginning of the exercise.  

Once they have written an algorithm, we will collect the Set A photos, distribute the 
Set B photos, and then write their classifications on the board.  The final reveal will 
happen after all answers are up.

Points for discussion are: 
  - Types of algorithms used
  - How good is this algorithm -- what do we mean by this?
  - What about features not covered in the test set (e.g. necklaces?)
  

**Answers:**
  - Training set (Set A) Hipsters: #3, 4, 8, 11, 14. 
  - Test Set (Set B) Hipsters: #5, 12, 13, 14.
