# Create a Repository on GitHub

## Step 1:  Go to your account on GitHub
- At upper right of webpage, click on the `+` next to your profile picture  
- Select `New repository`
- Name it `proj1-mta`
- Add a description:  `Project 1:  Exploring MTA Turnstile Data`
- Keep it "Public" unless you have a private account
- Check the box for `Initialize this repository with a README`
- Click on green button `Create repository`

## Step 2 (optional):  Create a test file
- Select `Create new file`
- Name it `test.md`
- Add a line `This is a test file`
- Save it (at bottom of webpage)

## Step 3 (optional):  Add a collaborator
- Go to `Settings`
- At left, select `Collaborators`
- Select `Confirm password`
- Add GitHub ID of collaborator

## Step 4:  Cloning the repo & Adding updates

- The steps for cloning the repo and updating it are the same as in the [Pre-work Git Tutorial Video](https://vimeo.com/178481263?mc_cid=06d951b22e&mc_eid=[UNIQID])  
- Here's a [list of commands used in the Git video](https://github.com/thisismetis/dsp/blob/master/resources/git_video_history.md)


## Takeaways
1.  You should create a separate repository for each project you work on.
2.  If you would like to keep the repository private, it is ~$7/month.  Also, Metis offers a GitHub Educational Discount.  More information on applying will be provided in Week 2 of the bootcamp.
